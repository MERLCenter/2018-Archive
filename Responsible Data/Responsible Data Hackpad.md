<h3><em>Curated by participants of MERL Tech.</em></h3>
 
Responsible data is:
The duty to ensure people’s rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership around the information processes of collection, analysis, storage, presentation and reuse of data, while respecting the values of transparency and openness.  (Responsible Data Forum, working definition, September 2014)

A slightly different definition (as outlined in work by Sonjara/mSTAR for USAID) considers responsible data as a balance between 1) responsible data use (e.g., being sure that development organizations actually use the data we collect/that have been collected and shared by others); 2) transparency and accountability (to those we collect data from, to those who fund data collection/use, to the public); and 3) data privacy and security when we are stewarding or using data we have collected.

Ethical considerations when using geospatial technologies for evidence generation (2018)
Geospatial technologies have transformed the way we visualize and understand social phenomena and physical environments. There are significant advantages in using these technologies and data however, their use also presents ethical dilemmas such as privacy and security concerns as well as the potential for stigma and discrimination resulting from being associated with particular locations. Therefore, the use of geospatial technologies and resulting data needs to be critically assessed through an ethical lens prior to implementation of programmes, analyses or partnerships. This paper examines the benefits, risks and ethical considerations when undertaking evidence generation using geospatial technologies. It is supplemented by a checklist that may be used as a practical tool to support reflection on the ethical use of geospatial technologies.

Mapping and Comparing Responsible Data Approaches (2016)
The need for a responsible data governance approach has now been recognized by a wide variety of organizations, both within and outside the humanitarian space. The goal of this paper is to examine some of these existing approaches and, based on a comparative analysis, to identify best practices and innovative approaches to governing data in humanitarian contexts. To that end, Leiden University’s Centre for Innovation and the Governance Laboratory at New York University (The GovLab) have together undertaken a mapping exercise of 17 existing responsible data approaches. Taken together, these can serve as a toolkit for any organizations—particularly those operating in the humanitarian space—seeking to use data more responsibly and effectively.

Ethical considerations when using social media for evidence generation (2018)
There are significant ethical implications in the adoption of technologies and the production and use of the resulting data for evidence generation. The potential benefits and opportunities need to be understood in conjunction with the potential risks and challenges. When using social media to directly engage children and their communities, or when establishing partnerships with these organizations for data collection and analysis, adoption of these technologies and their resultant data should not be exclusively driven by short-term necessity but also by the long-term needs of our younger partners. When engaging with social media and indeed most technology, thoughtfulness, reflection and ongoing interrogation is required. This paper examines the benefits, risks and ethical considerations when undertaking evidence generation: (a) using social media platforms and (b) using third-party data collected and analysed by social media services. It is supplemented by practical tools to support reflection on the ethical use of social media platforms and social media data.

<h2>DATA COLLECTION</h2> 

Improving Data Quality in Mobile Community-Based Health Information Systems–Guidelines for Design and Implementation from Measure Evaluation
Increasingly, community-based health programs collect data that flow into donor programs and national health information system(s) (HIS). Programs are turning to mobile health (mHealth) technology to address a variety of challenges, including those associated with paper-based reporting systems, such as inefficient filing systems and operational challenges including storage space associated with transporting paper forms and receiving data in a timely manner. Mobile technologies can help programs improve the completeness and accuracy of data, tap the potential for real-time reporting, and strengthen communication and supervisory feedback practices.

Public bodies regularly releasing personal information by accident in Excel files

When officers within public bodies release FOI information that they think they have anonymised, they import personally identifiable information and an attempt is made to summarise it in anonymous form, often using pivot tables or charts. We have seen a variety of public bodies, including councils, the police, and parts of the NHS, accidentally release personal information in this way.

Home office uses charity data map to deport rough sleepers
The Home Office secretly acquired sensitive data from , showing the nationality of people sleeping rough on the streets, in order to remove them from Britain, the Observer can reveal. Internal correspondence shows the Home Office repeatedly requesting and finally gaining access to a map created by the Greater London Authority (GLA) that identified and categorised rough sleepers by nationality. The secret arrangement meant frontline outreach workers tasked with helping the homeless by collating data for the GLA were inadvertently helping the Home Office to remove people who were from the EU or central eastern Europe. https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/19/home-office-secret-emails-data-homeless-eu-nationals

Scarcity of Data Protection Laws in Africa Leaves NGOs Exposed
The level of data protection regulations varies widely across the African continent. Some countries, such as Senegal, have rushed to adopt and implement regulations. But the majority have no legislation in place. And where efforts at regulations exist, experts are concerned that governments are primarily interested in giving themselves more leeway to pursue cybercrimes — or cybercritics — than they are in protecting people's data. This landscape of patchy privacy legislation presents a significant risk to local organizations working with marginalized communities or around sensitive subjects, leaving both themselves and the people they are trying to help vulnerable. It also creates problems for international groups looking to partner with local agencies, raising questions about what information can safely be gathered and shared.
